### Option: `blind`

Enter addresses for easy roll blinds you want to connect to Type `- ip address` as many blinds as you want

- For ports with ssl authentication, see `certfile`

### Option: `cafile` (optional)

A file containing a root certificate. Place this file in the Home Assistant `ssl` folder.

### Option: `certfile`

     - In that case, the client must trust the server's certificate
